# AUNIS-Control-System Private Version
This is the private version of the system which I use in my base. It has more functions, for example: detects incoming wormholes and sets off klaxons.

If you'd like to use this, you will need to install Opensecurity and connect an Alarm Block to the Gate Computer and you will need to configure the alarm sound.
If you'd like to use lockdown.lua, you will need to connect some doors/rolldoors and type their addresses in. You will also need to configure the password.
